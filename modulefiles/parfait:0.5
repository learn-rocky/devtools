  summary: Parfait Module
  description: >-
    Parfait is a Java performance monitoring library that exposes and collects metrics
    through a variety of outputs.  It provides APIs for extracting performance metrics
    from the JVM and other sources. It interfaces to Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) using
    the Memory Mapped Value (MMV) machinery for extremely lightweight instrumentation.

      unit-api:
        rationale: "The Unit of Measurement library provides a set of Java language
          programming interfaces for handling units and quantities. The interfaces
          provide a layer which separates client code, which would call the API, from
          library code, which implements the API.\nThe specification contains Interfaces
          and abstract classes with methods for unit operations:\n\n  * Checking of
          unit compatibility\n  * Expression of a quantity in various units\n  * Arithmetic
          operations on units"
