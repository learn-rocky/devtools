  summary: Vector-based drawing program using SVG
  description: >-
    Inkscape is a vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to

    Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Xara X, using the W3C standard Scalable Vector

    Graphics (SVG) file format.  It is therefore a very useful tool for web

    designers and as an interchange format for desktop publishing.


    Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha

    blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined

    interface. It is very easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations,

    trace bitmaps and much more.
