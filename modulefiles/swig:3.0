  summary: Connects C/C++/Objective C to some high-level programming languages
  description: >
    Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a software development tool
    for connecting C, C++ and Objective C programs with a variety of high-level programming
    languages. SWIG is primarily used with Perl, Python and Tcl/TK, but it has also
    been extended to Java, Eiffel and Guile. SWIG is normally used to create high-level
    interpreted programming environments, systems integration, and as a tool for building
    user interfaces
