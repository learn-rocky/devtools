  summary: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux Identity Management system module
  description: >-
    RHEL IdM is an integrated solution to provide centrally managed Identity (users,
    hosts, services), Authentication (SSO, 2FA), and Authorization (host access control,
    SELinux user roles, services). The solution provides features for further integration
    with Linux based clients (SUDO, automount) and integration with Active Directory
    based infrastructures (Trusts).
