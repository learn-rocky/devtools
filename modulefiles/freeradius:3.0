  summary: High-performance and highly configurable free RADIUS server
  description: >-
    The FreeRADIUS Server Project is a high performance and highly configurable GPL'd
    free RADIUS server. The server is similar in some respects to Livingston's 2.0
    server.  While FreeRADIUS started as a variant of the Cistron RADIUS server, they
    don't share a lot in common any more. It now has many more features than Cistron
    or Livingston, and is much more configurable.

    FreeRADIUS is an Internet authentication daemon, which implements the RADIUS protocol,
    as defined in RFC 2865 (and others). It allows Network Access Servers (NAS boxes)
    to perform authentication for dial-up users. There are also RADIUS clients available
    for Web servers, firewalls, Unix logins, and more.  Using RADIUS allows authentication
    and authorization for a network to be centralized, and minimizes the amount of
    re-configuration which has to be done when adding or deleting new users.
