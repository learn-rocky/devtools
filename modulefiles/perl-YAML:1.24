    summary: Perl parser for YAML
    description: >
        The YAML.pm module implements a YAML Loader and Dumper based on the
        YAML 1.0 specification. YAML is a generic data serialization language
        that is optimized for human readability. It can be used to express
        the data structures of most modern programming languages, including
        Perl. For information on the YAML syntax, please refer to the YAML
        specification.
