    summary: Connects C/C++/Objective C to some high-level programming languages
    description: >
        Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a software
        development tool for connecting C, C++ and Objective C programs
        with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is
        primarily used with Perl, Python and Tcl/TK, but it has also been
        extended to Java, Eiffel and Guile. SWIG is normally used to create
        high-level interpreted programming environments, systems
        integration, and as a tool for building user interfaces
